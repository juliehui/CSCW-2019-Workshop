## Workshop overview

While the shift to on-demand labor may foster greater control over one’s employment in some ways, it has removed much of the benefits that come with consistently working in shared physical spaces. Working in physical spaces allow opportunities for social support, earning, long-term growth, and stability. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate a discussion around how physical spaces and online technologies influence each other in on-demand work. We plan to invite a diversity of stakeholders, including grassroots organizers who can represent and voice the concerns of their respective worker communities, researchers studying these topics, and designers of on-demand work platforms. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be archived online and made available to the larger research community and the general public. 

## Guiding questions

- How might the on-demand nature of work help and/or hinder long-term stability, planning, and overall satisfaction?
- How might physical spaces augment on-demand work? 
- How does the on-demand nature of work change physical spaces of work? 
- How do we build a sense of shared “place” as work becomes more on-demand and distributed?

## Workshop activities

- **Reflect** on trends in research and practice with respect to the “de-placing” of work through on-demand digital mediation. 
- **Ideate** opportunities for where physical workplaces can complement and/or on-demand work and visa versa to address challenges identified in the reflection.
- **Prototype** concrete plans or takeaways that the CSCW, and broader, community can takeaway when considering the role of “place” in on-demand work. 

## Outcomes

- We plan to write up a report on the outcomes of this workshop in the form of an ACM Communications article and corresponding blog post.
